Together with economic figures as collected by `Statistik Austria <https://www.statistik.at> <https://www.statistik.at>`_, the local economic impact of world-wide conflict is calculated.\nWARNING: While this student is fairly confident regarding the numerical quality of the calculations, any conclusions have to be regarded as having worse-than-questionable statistical validity."
