However, although plenty of articles about predicting phishing websites have been disseminated these days, no reliable training dataset has been published publically, may be because there is no agreement in literature on the definitive features that characterize phishing webpages, hence it is difficult to shape a dataset that covers all possible features. In this dataset, we shed light on the important features that have proved to be sound and effective in predicting phishing websites. In addition, we propose some new features.",
